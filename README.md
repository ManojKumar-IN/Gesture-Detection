# Gesture-Detection

## Purpose : this project aims to capture the hand gesture on live camera feed and and classify multiple hand gestures using deep learning algos.

## Requirements/steps to perform

1. Capture image from live camera feed
2. perform scaling and orientation on image
3. feed it to ML algo
4. choose which ML algo to use from
5. finalise numbers of gestures and classify them into different buckets
6. gather test set to train the algos for each bucket
6. train the alogorithm
7. Improve accuracy
8. peform live test
9. create box around the gesture
10. use the output to perform the task on windows.
